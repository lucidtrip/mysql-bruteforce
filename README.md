# MYSQL Bruteforcer
very simpel but it works nice

## USAGE
you need a file like
```127.0.0.1:3306
192.168.0.0:3306
192.168.255.255:3306
etc...
```
and start bruteforce with
```bash
bash mysqlfb.sh results.txt
```
for setting the threads look in the script line 14 with xargs...
its the first version in future come a better handling

## like u have a nice day
